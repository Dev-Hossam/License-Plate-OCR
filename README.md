# ðŸš˜ License Plate Recognition with YOLOv8 & PaddleOCR

This project provides a complete pipeline for detecting and extracting license plate text from car images using **YOLOv8 for detection** and **PaddleOCR for optical character recognition (OCR)**. Pretrained models are included for immediate use â€” no training required.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 (and variants) used to locate license plates in images.
- **Text Recognition:** PaddleOCR extracts plate numbers from detected regions.
- **Preprocessing:** Image enhancement (e.g., CLAHE) improves OCR accuracy.
- **Pretrained Models:** Provided for immediate inference â€” no dataset needed.
